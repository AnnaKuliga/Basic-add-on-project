            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>
              To understand the photography definition it is important to break
              down the word itself. The Greek meaning of ‘photo’ translates to
              ‘light’ while ‘graphy’ translates to ‘drawing.’ Therefore, the
              word photography can quite literally translate to light drawing or
              drawing with light. Simply put, photography is the process of
              capturing light to create an image. This is executed through the
              use of a camera, either film or digital. The practice of capturing
              light to create images is used for various purposes.

          <h3>How does photography work</h3>
          <p>
            The photography definition may give a general breakdown of what
            photography is, but how does photography work specifically and how
            is light captured to create an image? To understand this, you must
            understand the exposure triangle. Ever since the invention of
            photography and the invention of the camera, these three components
            of photography have been critical in creating images from light.

              <h4>Aperture</h4>
              <p>
                Aperture is the opening of the lens through which light passes.
                When you hit the shutter release button to take the picture, the
                camera aperture opens to the predetermined width, letting a
                specific amount of light through.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="iso">
              <h4>ISO</h4>
              <p>
                Once light passes through the aperture of a camera lens, it
                lands on either a sensor (in digital photography) or light
                sensitive film stock (in film photography). ISO is what measures
                your camera’s digital sensor’s sensitivity to light or your film
                stock’s sensitivity to light.

            <div class="shutter">
              <h4>Shutter Speed</h4>
              <p>
                The final component of the exposure triangle is shutter speed.
                Shutter speed is how long the camera shutter is open, exposing
                the image to light, typically measured in milliseconds to
                minutes.
